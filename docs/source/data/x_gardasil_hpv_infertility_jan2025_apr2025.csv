No way that we were allowing this into her)..\n\nInexplicably, this dangerous vaccine contains L-histidine, an essential amino acid, which plays a vital role in pregnancy; the synthetic form of which can also pass through the placental wall to the fetus. This could be the direct cause to the spontaneous miscarriage and birth defects in some of the babies.\n\nWhenever a vital, naturally occurring substance such as L-histidine is injected into the body subcutaneously or intramuscularly (alongside heavy metals, live/attenuated viruses, detergents & antibiotic excipients etc), a counter effect inevitably occurs where-in the immune system cannot differentiate between the naturally occurring amino acid in the body from that present in the vaccine; registering all these intruders as a common enemy of toxic debris. The immune system instinctively kicks into overdrive, alerting any available antibodies throughout the body to identify & eliminate deposits of L-histidine it encounters in its path.\n\nThe end result, in each case, we‚Äôre seeing the antithesis of nature‚Äôs course develop, as the body, stripped of one or more primary components, is now, in essence, at war with itself.
