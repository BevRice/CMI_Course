Counter Malign Influence 
========================

Welcome to the Counter Malign Influence Course!

In this course, 'counter malign influence' refers to the strategic detection and mitigation of misinformation, harmful information campaignsâ€”such as disinformation, propaganda, and other manipulative tacticsâ€”that can distort public discourse and undermine trust.

This course emphasizes individual, critical thinking, and introduces data analytics using Python, focusing on real-world applications in detecting and countering malign influence. By the end of this course, you will have practical experience in data acquisition, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and analysis, with a strong emphasis on combating misinformation.

Course Overview

This course is structured into four weeks of core instruction, followed by a two-week practical challenge where you will apply your knowledge to analyze real-world cases.

Each week consists of:

    - Guided Lessons: Interactive Jupyter Notebooks with explanations and exercises.

    - Guest Speaker Sessions: Experts from academia, government, and industry sharing insights on misinformation.

    - Assignments & Challenges: Hands-on exercises and projects reinforcing critical thinking and analytical skills.
