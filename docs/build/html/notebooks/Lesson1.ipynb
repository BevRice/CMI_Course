    "Information, on the other hand, is processed, organized, or structured data that provides meaning and knowledge. It has context, making it useful for decision-making and communication.\n",

    "    - 1.\tIt’s organized—structured in a way that makes sense.  \n",
    "    - 2.\tIt’s contextualized—relevant to a specific situation.  \n",

    "So let’s talk about misinformation and disinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look up these terms on ChatGPT, Google, DuckDuckGo, or even in peer-reviewed academic papers, you’ll quickly realize that there’s no universal consensus on their definitions.\n",
    "One paper, Defining Misinformation and Related Terms in Health-Related Literature, analyzed 75 different definitions for misinformation. Even experts in the field disagree on whether things like propaganda or satire should be classified as misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we’ll use a broad framework that aligns with common discussions on the topic. However, understand that definitions vary depending on who you ask.\n",
    "At its core, misinformation and disinformation refer to false or misleading information—but the key difference is intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break this down using the graphic on the slide:  \n",
    "    •\tMisinformation occurs when someone shares false or misleading information without malicious intent. They genuinely believe it’s true and spread it to inform or help others.  \n",
    "    •\tDisinformation is deliberately created or spread to manipulate, deceive, or serve an agenda.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, imagine someone sharing an anti-vaccine article:  \n",
    "    •\tYour aunt might forward it because she truly believes vaccines are harmful and wants to warn people. That would be misinformation.  \n",
    "    •\tYour neighbor, however, runs an anti-vaccine Instagram page and deliberately posts the same article to stir controversy, increase engagement, and earn more money from ads. That would be disinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While intent is a key factor, it’s not always clear-cut. Some content creators may claim they were ‘just joking’ or ‘raising questions’ to avoid responsibility, even if their messaging spreads falsehoods. In these cases, context, patterns of behavior, and motivations become important factors in determining intent.  While the terms are modern, the concepts are ancient...humans have been spreading misleading information for centuries.\n"

    "Throughout history, people have used myths, legends, and falsehoods to explain natural events, uphold power, and shape societal beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take Norse mythology—the idea that Thor’s hammer caused thunder. While this explanation made sense to people at the time, it’s not scientifically accurate. If taken literally, it could be considered misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, consider the Divine Right of Kings—the belief that monarchs ruled because of God’s will. This concept was reinforced through religious texts, myths, and propaganda, which helped keep monarchs in power. Because it was often deliberately spread to justify rule and control people, it falls under disinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more harmful historical example is Blood Libel—an antisemitic falsehood from the Middle Ages accusing Jewish people of ritual murder. This started as misinformation, based on existing prejudices, but it became disinformation when leaders intentionally spread it to vilify Jewish communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the invention of printing, misinformation and disinformation became easier to spread and harder to erase. The oldest surviving printed book, the Diamond Sutra, is depicted above and has preserved and disseminated its ideas over generations.  Printed materials, whether accurate or not, have the ability to preserve misinformation fover time.  It can also give certain ideologies and narratives longevity, sometimes solidifying them as historical truths even if they were misleading. The Gutenberg Press took this further, enabling the mass production of texts, meaning false information could reach more people faster—a trend we’ll see repeating in later eras.\n"

    "During the Cold War, misinformation and disinformation became key tools of statecraft. Intelligence agencies, propaganda ministries, and media outlets were mobilized to distort facts, manufacture narratives, and suppress dissenting viewpoints.\n",

    "The KGB ran extensive disinformation campaigns, including fabricating documents, planting false stories in Western media, and supporting front organizations to spread anti-American sentiments. One notable example was \"Operation INFEKTION,\" a campaign to spread the false claim that the U.S. created HIV/AIDS as a bioweapon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. and its allies countered Soviet disinformation with their own information campaigns. Radio Free Europe and Voice of America broadcast Western perspectives behind the Iron Curtain, providing censored information to Soviet-bloc populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sides infiltrated and manipulated news organizations to amplify favorable narratives. The CIA secretly funded magazines, newspapers, and cultural organizations to promote democracy and capitalism, while the USSR funneled resources into Communist-aligned publications worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propaganda became a defining feature of Cold War society. Governments, media, and entertainment industries were used to instill ideological loyalty and vilify the opposing bloc.\n",
    "Anti-Communist propaganda flourished in the U.S., portraying Communists as existential threats to democracy. Government-led efforts, such as the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), targeted suspected Communists in media, academia, and politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cold War era saw transformative advancements in communication technologies, which both facilitated and complicated information control.\n",
    "By the 1950s, television became the dominant medium for news and political messaging. Governments used televised speeches, documentaries, and news reports to influence public opinion. Iconic moments, such as the televised Nixon-Khrushchev \"Kitchen Debate\" and the moon landing, became ideological battlegrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments began using computational analysis for intelligence gathering, propaganda dissemination, and surveillance. The U.S. ARPANET, a precursor to the internet, emerged as a military project for secure communication, laying the groundwork for the digital age.\n",
    "Satellites revolutionized communication, enabling real-time broadcasting across continents. The 1960 launch of the first weather satellite and subsequent Cold War spy satellites transformed military intelligence and news dissemination, making information warfare more immediate and impactful.\n"

    "We now live in the digital and social media age, where the proliferation of mobile technology and smartphones has made access to information, misinformation, and disinformation instantaneous. Never before has false or misleading content been able to spread so quickly or reach such vast audiences with just a few taps on a screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major example was the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, which underscored the significant role of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in amplifying misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign actors, particularly Russia’s Internet Research Agency, orchestrated a large-scale disinformation campaign that leveraged automated bot accounts, coordinated troll farms, and micro-targeted political advertisements to manipulate public opinion.  Automated bot networks artificially boosted misleading content, making it appear more popular and credible than it actually was.  Troll farms created and managed fake social media accounts that posed as American citizens, engaging in divisive discussions, spreading false claims, and attacking political candidates.  Targeted disinformation ads used Facebook’s micro-targeting features to push inflammatory messages to specific demographic groups, often exploiting existing social and racial tensions.  Fabricated news stories—such as false claims about voter fraud, rigged ballots, or conspiracy theories linking candidates to criminal activity—were widely shared across platforms, influencing public perceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The digital age has pushed many users into echo chambers and filter bubbles. Because algorithms tailor content to individual preferences, people are increasingly exposed only to information that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs. This reinforces biases, reduces critical engagement with opposing viewpoints, and makes misinformation even harder to recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore why misinformation is so believable in the next lecture, but for now, keep in mind that the combination of mobile technology, algorithm-driven content, and bot networks has fundamentally changed how misinformation spreads in the modern era.\n"
