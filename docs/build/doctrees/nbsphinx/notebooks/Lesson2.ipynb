    "- **Cognitive Biases** → Mental shortcuts that distort how we interpret information.\n",
    "- **Heuristics** → Quick, intuitive judgments that simplify decision-making but can lead to **errors**.\n",
    "- **Emotional Triggers** → Fear, outrage, and humor **bypass critical thinking**, making falsehoods more persuasive.\n",

    "- The film **portrayed viewers as \"brave truth-seekers\"**, appealing to a sense of **personal empowerment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 *Critical Thinking in Action:*\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 What is Vertical Reading?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical reading** is the traditional method of evaluating information by **staying within a single source**. This approach involves:  \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Checking the **website’s About page** to determine credibility.  \n",
    "✔ Scanning the **author’s credentials** and publication date.  \n",
    "✔ Looking for **spelling errors or poor formatting** as credibility indicators.  \n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 **Example of Vertical Reading:**  \n",
    "A student finds an article claiming \"Climate Change is a Hoax\" on **www.truthnewsinfo.com**. Using vertical reading, they:  \n",

    "- Misinformation websites **appear credible**, even when they aren’t.  \n",

    "- The About page is **controlled by the website itself** and may be misleading.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "**Lateral reading** is the **gold standard** for fact-checking. Instead of staying within the website, lateral readers **open multiple sources and cross-check**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Search for **independent verification** using reputable sources.  \n",
    "✔ Investigate the **author’s real credentials** outside the original website.  \n",

    "✅ **Google the website name + \"reliable\" or \"bias\"** → They find fact-checking articles exposing the site as unreliable.  \n",
    "✅ **Search for the author’s name** → They find no credible records of Dr. John Doe’s climate expertise.  \n",
