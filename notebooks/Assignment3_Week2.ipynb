    "This assignment will guide you through the process of **formulating research questions** and **identifying and evaluating appropriate datasets** for MDM analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the framework explored in Lesson 4, you will:  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Develop 3-5 structured research questions** related to your chosen misinformation narrative from Assignment 1.  \n",
    "✅ **Identify at least one relevant dataset** that aligns with your research questions.  \n",
    "✅ **Evaluate your dataset(s) based on structure, credibility, and reliability using systematic data assessment methods.  \n",
    "\n",

    "**📌 Tips for Writing Strong Research Questions:**  \n",
    "✔ **Focus on specific data points** (e.g., engagement metrics, amplification patterns, key influencers).  \n",
    "✔ **Ensure the question is measurable** (e.g., number of shares, sentiment analysis, bot detection).  \n",
    "✔ **Keep it aligned with available data sources** (e.g., social media datasets, fact-checking databases).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
