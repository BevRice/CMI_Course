    "**Assignment Overview**  \n",
    "This assignment is designed to help you critically evaluate the challenges of **data bias and AI-driven misinformation detection** through real-world case studies. By analyzing the two case studies, you will assess the limitations of misinformation detection models, explore algorithmic bias, and propose strategies for mitigating bias in misinformation research.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you will have developed an understanding of:  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ The risks of **single-platform misinformation detection models**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ The ethical dilemmas of **AI-driven misinformation detection**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ The impact of **bias and transparency concerns** in misinformation research  \n",

    "  \n",
    "- What are the risks of developing a misinformation detection system trained on data from a single social media platform?\n",
    "- How might misinformation patterns differ across platforms (e.g., Twitter vs. TikTok vs. Facebook)?\n",
    "- What steps could researchers take to ensure a broader, more representative dataset while maintaining efficiency?\n",
    "- If platform restrictions (e.g., API access limitations) prevent multi-platform data collection, what alternative solutions could mitigate bias?\n",

    "2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Case Study 2: Algorithmic Bias in AI-Powered Misinformation Detection](https://github.com/BevRice/CMI_Course/discussions/5)**  \n",
    "- Should they adjust the AI model to allow for more human moderation, or would this introduce additional bias?\n",
    "- How can they balance misinformation detection without infringing on free speech?\n",
    "- Should platforms be fully transparent about how their AI models detect and flag misinformation?\n",
